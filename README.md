# geotiff.io
Static website for viewing GeoTIFF's in the browser

## Why?
It's too much of a pain to view and manipulate raster data.  The aim of this project is to make it easier by just doing it in your web browser.

# Current Features
- View TIFF file
- Identify Pixel Value

# Features Coming Soon
- Calculate Average of Values of Cells in Area
- Draw Polygon
- Upload Polygon
- Sum Pixels inside Area
- Basic Zonal Stats inside Area
- Clip Raster by Another Raster

## Very Simple
GeoTIFF.io redesigns the traditional GIS approach.  No longer, must you learn buttonology, what every icon stands for and where to find it.  GeoTIFF.io has a simple search interface where you can find everything you need.

## Very Secure
GeoTIFF.io runs all the tools and processes in your own browser.  This means that any data you upload or link to is never sent anywhere.  GeoTIFF.io works behind the firewall, allowing you to process TIFF's behind a VPN.

## No Install Required
GeoTIFF.io is just a website, that's it.  It's just a collection of your standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  Unlike ArcMap and QGIS, no install is required.  Just point your browser to https://geotiff.io.
